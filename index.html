<h1><strong>My H2 Computing Journey</strong></h1>
<br>

<strong> Name: <strong> Aqeel Shauqi <br>
<strong> School: <strong> Anderson Serangoon Junior College

<h2><strong><u> About Me</u> </strong></h2>
<p>I am deeply passionate about digital art. Ever since I got an ipad that came with an apple pencil around 4 years ago, I have been drawing digitally as a hobby very frequently. Right now, I draw mainly for fun, but with every drawing, I aim to improve my skills and become a better artist, in hopes that I can use these skills professionally in the future.</p>

  <p>Other than that, I also have a significant interest in photography and video editing. A camera cannot always capture the beauty of what we see with our own eyes, so the challenge of doing so facsinates me. Creating a video that is engaging is arguably more difficult, in a fun way. I have been editing short videos occasionally, mainly of shows/movies I enjoy.</p>

<h2><strong><u> Achievements and Events </u> </strong></h2>

<strong> <u>Anderson Secondary School:</u> <strong><br><br> Played in the Anderson Military Band and took part in various events such as SYF 2021 and 2023 as well as the ChengSan CC Carnival  <br><br>
Pitched a design in front of school for a Digital Mascot Design Competition <br><br>

<strong> <u>Anderson Serangoon Junior College:</u> <strong><br><br> (to be filled)  <br>



<h2><strong><u>  Why did I take computing?</u>  </strong></h2>


 <p>
I took H2 Computing as coding had always been an interest I had. I wanted to find out how things worked, and how I could make my own code. In addition, due to the rise of technology, namely artificial intelligence, I figured joining H2 computing would help me understand better the direction the world is heading towards, and open up more opportunities for me to explore. 
  </p>
<p>
I hope to be able to use the knowledge and skills I learn to potentially land a job in the future and make fun projects for myself.
